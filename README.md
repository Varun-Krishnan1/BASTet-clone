# BASTet-clone

**NOTE: setup.py does not work yet so do not install with package manager** 
Rather, clone repository to folder with jupyter notebook then use sys.path.append('BASTet-clone') as a crude workaround

## Original Code
Duplicated from https://github.com/biorack/BASTet 

## Changes 
Converted from python2 -> python3 using 2to3 library 
*NOTE: not all functions checked for compatability with python3* 

Fixed encoding error in msidata.py to make it compatible with python3
